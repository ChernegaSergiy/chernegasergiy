# Hi, I'm Serhii! 👋

## About Me

I’m a developer who believes that even the simplest tools — like **CSS** — can change lives.

You don’t have to be an expert to make a difference. I live by this every day, and through small, thoughtful steps, I try to make the digital world a better, more humane place — both for myself and for others.

I focus on making technology clear, accessible, and genuinely useful. I create solutions that solve real-world problems, simplify workflows, and bring clarity where complexity once stood. For me, code is more than logic — it's a way to help, express, and create meaning.

In my work, **creativity and structure go hand in hand**. Whether it's a single line of CSS or a full system architecture, I care deeply about every detail. And I try to inspire others to believe that they can shape the digital world too — starting with what they already know.

> 💡 **“CSS will change the world.”**  
> Not just a motto — a belief I live by. It changed my life, and I believe it can change yours too.
